#variables - only letters, digits, periods, underscores. no special symbols, like @;
x = 10
print(x) # prints function
typeof(x) #shows what the variable is, like double for an integer
class(x) #shows what field, like numeric, a string would be character
#you will learn how to name as you go

#Data Types
  #Logical - TRUE/FALSE
  #Numeric - 10.5, 7, 845
  #Integer - 3L, 40L, 4L
  #Complex - 3+2i
  #Character - 'a', 'hello', '13.5' as long as it is in single brackets
  #Raw - 'Hello' is stored as 48 65 6c 6c 6f

#if I want integer instead of double, i change x = 10 to x = 10L
x=10
typeof(x)
x=10L
