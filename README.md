# R_Tutorial

This repository contains my notes and code from completing an R programming tutorial. It covers fundamental and essential topics in R, including data structures, control flow, data manipulation, and visualization.

## Topics Covered

- **Variables & Data Types**  
  Understanding how to assign and work with different types of data in R (numeric, character, logical, etc.).

- **Logical Operators**  
  Using `==`, `!=`, `&`, `|`, `!`, and other comparison tools for conditional logic.

- **Data Structures**  
  - **Vectors** – Ordered collections of elements of the same type.  
  - **Lists** – Collections of elements of different types.  
  - **Matrices** – Two-dimensional arrays of elements.  
  - **Data Frames** – Table-like structures for handling datasets.

- **Flow Control**  
  Using `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `repeat` to control the execution of code.

- **Functions**  
  Writing and using custom functions to organize reusable code.

- **Data Manipulation with dplyr**  
  Filtering, selecting, mutating, grouping, and summarizing data efficiently using the `dplyr` package.

- **Data Tidying with tidyr**  
  Reshaping and cleaning datasets for analysis using `pivot_longer`, `pivot_wider`, `separate`, and `unite`.

- **Data Visualization with ggplot2**  
  Creating customizable plots including bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and more.

## What I Learned

This tutorial helped me gain a solid understanding of R for data analysis and visualization. The experience also gave me hands-on practice with key packages in the R ecosystem.
